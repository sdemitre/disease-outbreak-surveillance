## **PRESENTATION DELIVERY GUIDE**

### **Slide Timing:**
- **Slides 1-2**: 30 seconds (Opening hook)
- **Slides 3-7**: 60 seconds (Core features - 12 seconds per slide)  
- **Slide 8**: 45 seconds (Technical excellence)
- **Slides 9-11**: 60 seconds (Real-world impact - 20 seconds each)
- **Slides 12-14**: 45 seconds (Call to action - 15 seconds each)
- **Slide 15**: During Q&A period

### **Visual Demonstration Tips:**
1. **Live Website Demo**: Have the actual GDOSN website open in another tab
2. **Interactive Elements**: Show clicking on outbreak markers during Slide 5
3. **Filtering Demo**: Demonstrate severity/disease type filters during Slide 5  
4. **Research Integration**: Show research repository during Slide 6
5. **Dashboard Statistics**: Point to real numbers during Slide 4

### **Presenter Notes:**
- **Keep slides simple** - audience should focus on your words, not text
- **Use slides as visual reinforcement** of your verbal pitch
- **Transition smoothly** between slides without reading them aloud
- **Point to specific elements** when demonstrating features
- **End with confidence** - this platform exists and works now

### **Backup Plan:**
If internet is unavailable for live demo, use **screenshots** of key website sections embedded in slides 4, 5, and 12.
